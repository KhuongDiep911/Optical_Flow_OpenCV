""" J.Madge 23.04.2018, 'ops.py'.

    Module containing functions which wrap up core optical flow functionality
    from the OpenCV library 'cv2'. Operations are divided into those which
    obtain results and those that create visualisations. The results can
    therefore be obtained for further processing independent of visualisations
    being created.
